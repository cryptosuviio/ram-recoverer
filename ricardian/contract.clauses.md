<h1 class="clause">UserAgreement</h1>

The intention of this contract is to recover RAM on Telos Blockchain Network from unclaimed accounts per Telos Blockchain Network Operating Agreement, and its community approved amendment #0: https://chainspector.io/governance/ratify-proposals/0

We think that recovering TLOS (already done) and RAM is way better option than nullifying the account keys.
This way the account itself can still be used in the future, if desired so.
